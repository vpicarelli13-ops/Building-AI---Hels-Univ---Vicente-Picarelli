Ai Stylist – Readme (building Ai Course Project)
WardrobeWise – AI Stylist for Men

Final project for the Building AI course

Summary

Building AI course project. WardrobeWise is an AI stylist that organizes a man’s wardrobe from photos and suggests context‑aware outfit combinations. It reduces decision fatigue and improves confidence by recommending looks tailored to the user’s style, body, and upcoming occasions (≈250 chars).

Background

Many men struggle to combine clothes, end up repeating the same outfits, and waste time deciding what to wear. Lack of fashion knowledge, little time, and insecurity often lead to poor purchases and low confidence.

Problems solved

Digitize and organize the wardrobe with real photos of the user’s items.

Recommend intelligent outfit combinations for different contexts (work, casual, formal, weather).

Suggest missing pieces in the wardrobe ("a dark pair of pants would complement these shirts").

Motivation

Democratize practical and personalized style advice without the need for a personal stylist.

How is it used?

Onboarding: the user photographs each item (front/flat lay) with a plain background. The app guides the framing and auto‑removes the background.

Cataloging: AI recognizes clothing type, color, pattern, fabric, season, and when possible, brand/size.

Outfit generation: the user selects an occasion (e.g., “smart casual office,” “formal dinner”), preferences, and local weather; AI suggests full looks and variations.

Feedback loop: the user rates suggestions (“like/dislike/more formal”), improving personalization over time.

Planning: wardrobe calendar for weekly outfits or packing lists, avoiding over‑repetition.

Fashion suggestions (optional): recommends new pieces that maximize combinations with existing clothes.

Users and needs

Men who want practicality and confidence when dressing.

Time‑constrained users, fashion beginners, or those who want to optimize purchases.

Data sources and AI methods

Data

Photos of the user’s wardrobe (primary source).

Public/licensed fashion datasets and catalogs for pre‑training classification models.

Metadata from app usage: outfit preferences, occasions, weather (consented, respecting privacy).

AI methods

Segmentation to crop clothing items from the background.

Classification to identify type of clothing (shirt, pants, jacket…), pattern (plain, striped, checked), colors (HSV/LAB), and attributes (collar, sleeve, fabric).

Embeddings for similarity search and outfit compatibility.

Hybrid recommendation system:

Rule‑based style logic (color theory, dress codes).

Learned compatibility model (contrastive learning).

Personalization from explicit/implicit feedback.

Light NLP for interpreting preferences (“I like minimalist, neutral tones”).

Reinforcement/online learning to adapt recommendations in real time.

Challenges

Onboarding effort: photographing all clothes may feel tedious; mitigated with batch capture and quick recognition.

Lighting/background variation: affects color detection; mitigated with normalization.

Fit/body context: item fit not visible in photo; mitigated by size questionnaire.

Context (weather, etiquette): requires external data and cultural adaptation.

Privacy: clothing photos and preferences are sensitive; mitigate with consent, encryption, and local/on‑device processing options.

Bias: training data may reflect narrow fashion styles; mitigate by including diverse references.

What next?

MVP: guided capture → catalog → basic outfit recommendations (casual/work/formal) → feedback loop.

Integrations: calendar (events), weather APIs, e‑commerce (wish list), travel packing planner.

Expansions: female/children fashion, capsule wardrobe planning, stylist collaboration.

Explainable AI: justify each suggestion (“dark pants balance the striped shirt; brown shoes match the belt”).
